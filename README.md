# Corner-based-brain-img-classifier

First, use matlab code to extract MTIs and corners with importance-values
Second, use java codes to proceed corner matching, similarity calculation, KNN-based classification. 
        Based on the accuarcy of validation data, we chose the best theta and K to construct a classifier
